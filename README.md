Serenity Flow 🧘‍♀️ - A Wellness Session Platform
Welcome, future developer! This is a complete Full-Stack web application that allows users to create, share, and discover wellness sessions like yoga, meditation, and more. It's a perfect project to showcase your skills in building modern web apps from scratch.

This project was built with the MERN Stack:

MongoDB (our database)
Express.js (our server framework)
React.js (our user interface library)
Node.js (our server environment)
(Feel free to replace this with a screenshot of your own running app!)

✨ Features
User Accounts: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Create Sessions: Logged-in users can create new wellness sessions, providing details like title, description, duration, and category.
Manage Your Content: A "My Studio" page where creators can view, edit, and manage their own sessions.
Draft & Publish System: Sessions can be saved as a "draft" (private) or "published" (visible to everyone).
Public Dashboard: A main dashboard where anyone can see all the published wellness sessions.
Search & Filter: Easily find sessions by searching for keywords or filtering by category and difficulty.
Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices thanks to Tailwind CSS.
💻 Tech Stack
Frontend:
⚛️ React.js - For building the user interface.
🎨 Tailwind CSS - For beautiful and fast styling.
🛣️ React Router - For handling navigation between pages.
✨ Lucide Icons - For clean and modern icons.
Backend:
🟢 Node.js - The JavaScript runtime for our server.
🚀 Express.js - A fast and minimal web framework for our API.
Database:
🍃 MongoDB - A NoSQL database to store our user and session data.
📖 Mongoose - To model our data and connect to MongoDB easily.
Authentication:
🔐 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - For keeping our users securely logged in.
🚀 Getting Started
Ready to run this project on your own computer? Follow these simple steps!

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Node.js (which includes npm, the package manager)
MongoDB (make sure the database service is running)
Git (for cloning the project)
Installation Steps
Clone the project repository: Open your terminal and run this command:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd wellness-platform
Set up the Backend (Server):

Navigate into the backend folder:

cd backend
Install all the necessary packages:

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder. This file holds your secret keys. Copy the contents from .env.example (if you have one) or just create a new file and add the following:

# .env example
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/wellness-platform
JWT_SECRET=thisisareallystrongandsecretkeythatnoonecan 
PORT = 5000


Start the backend server:

npm run dev
You should see a message like MongoDB connected and Server running on port 5000. Leave this terminal running!

Set up the Frontend (Client):

Open a new terminal window. Don't close the backend one!
Navigate into the frontend folder from the project root:
cd frontend
Install all the necessary packages:
npm install
Start the React development server:
npm start
You're all set! Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000, where you can see the application live! 🎉
